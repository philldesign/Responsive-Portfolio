                <p>Hi there! I am Filipe, but you may call me Phill if it is easier.</p>
                <p>Long long long long time ago, I decided to study marketing after high school.
                    But I found it boring. The only aspect I enjoyed of it was the creative and visuals.</p>
                <p>So I decided to study graphic design. After a couple years I went to UConn Stamford and motion
                    graphics was my area of study. I was able to do all this crazy things with my designs.</p>
                <p>But I saw the industry was begging for people who now how to create for the web too. And that is how
                    I got here. Hopefully I will be able to sue everything I have learned so far and apply it to this
                    new adventure.</p>
                <p>Fin.</p>
